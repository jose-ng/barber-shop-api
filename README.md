Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine:

## Notes

- There is no data persistence
- There is no authentication
- There is no cors restrictions
- Only works in local 
- The only endpoint is http://localhost:4000/graphql and only could use request with POST
- This proyect is a most basic API to use GraphQl, it'll need more improvements
